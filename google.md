Unit 2  Interactivity with p5.js How can we make a program interactive?
Lesson 2 Conditional Statements How can we use mouse position to make a sketch interactive?


 Describe the task:  This lab expands on the previous in-class example by using conditionals to make a “sunset”:
Student Activity: Sunset Lab
Share  starter code  for students to duplicate and save.
In this example, the yPosition variable is initialized inside the draw loop instead of at the top of the sketch.
Students can use this color picker tool.
Students should follow the prompts below:

Make the default background light blue
Make the fill yellow
Change the yPosition variable to 100
Change mouseX to mouseY
Inside the if statement:
Change the background to dark blue
Change the fill to white
Write a new line of code that changes the yPosition variable to 350
BONUS: Make the moon look like a crescent moon! Write another conditional for when mouseY is greater than 200, draw a dark blue ellipse with the same y position as the moon, but an x position slightly to the left.

Provide a critique on the result. Things to consider:
      - Was it useful? The results were solutions to the lab - this could be useful for students who are struggling.  
      - Was it too simple/complex?  It was a simple assignments
      - Was it unnecessarily complicated?  No, It was not complicated.
      - Did it include copy pastable code? Yes the code was copy pastable
