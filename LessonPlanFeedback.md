#### I had originally planned to do a lesson where students used p5js shape, fill, stroke, strokeWeight to create an emoji representative of them and their community but it did not align to the data standard.  My group members advised on how to incorporate data by having students create an array of emoji names, for example.  I decided to do a data analysis lesson instead.  Harrison suggested asking students to define data and share examples of data in their lives and elicit why data analysis is important and I added that feedback to the lesson.
