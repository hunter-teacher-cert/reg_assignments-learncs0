*Note to DW: I have not taught any CS classes in the past so I explored different tools to teach an intro data analysis lesson* 

### Option 1- Code.org - Exploring Data Visualization
#### Learning Goal: students will practice making conclusions from charts and learn to use the Data Visualizer in App Lab  
#### Procedure:  
1. Make a bar chart for each column in the "Dogs" dataset and categorize it as either "useful" or "not useful" 
2. Make a histogram for the "Max Weight" column of the "Dogs" data set and choose the "Bucket Size" that you think is most helpful for interpreting the data.
3. What bucket size did you choose? Why do you think this is the most helpful bucket size for this chart?
4. What is the most common range of maximum weights for dog breeds?
5. What is the least common range of maximum weights for dog breeds?
6. Choose another dataset within App Lab and import it into your project. You can use the “More Info” button to learn more about a dataset before importing it
7. Find a column that looks interesting and make either a bar chart or histogram from the data.
8. What is one piece of information someone could learn from your chart?

### Option 2- Exploring Graphing M&Ms Candy with Excel Modified from The National Center for Quality Afterschool
#### Learning Goals:
1. Collect data through observations
2. Represent data using tables and graphs (Google sheets or Excel)
3. Enter data into a spreadsheet, use formulas and create a pie and bar graph
4. Use ratios and proportions to represent relationships among quantities
#### Procedure:
1. Open a google docs spreadsheet and name it candy m&m color comparisons 
2. Label cell A3 (color)
3. Label cell B3 (number of color)
4. Label cell C3 (% of color)
5. Enter the colors in A4-A9 (blue, brown, geen, red, orange, yellow)
6. Label A10 (total) 
7. Count the number of M&Ms of each color in your bag and enter the data in the appropriate cell.
8. Sum B4:B9 in B10
9. In C1 calculate the percentage of of blue =B1/B17*100 and do the same for the other colors
10. Create a bar chart (insert chart) to display the percentage (y axis) of each color (x axis) and a pie chart
11. Compare and contrast data
12. Use the actual candy to create a real model of the graphs
13. Alternatively if candy is not available students can this data 10% blue 30% brown 10% green 20% red 10% orange 20% yellow
