https://sedl.org/afterschool/lessonplans/index.cgi?show_record=100 

### Example Spreadsheet with data:  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y7dEHoOIZHGLcJEdVup-N82suGX5gR4GKe3U0OzVZFg/edit?usp=sharing 

### Learning Goals:
#### Collect data through observations
#### Represent data using tables and graphs (by means of MS-Excel)
#### Enter data into a spreadsheet, use formulas and create a pie graph
#### Use ratios and proportions to represent relationships among quantities


Procedure:
1. Open a google docs spreadsheet and name it candy m&m color comparisons 
2. Label cell A3 (color)
3. Label cell B3 (number of color)
4. Label cell C3 (% of color)
5. Enter the colors in A4-A9 (blue, brown, geen, red, orange, yellow)
6. Label A10 (total) 
7. Count the number of M&Ms of each color in your bag and enter the data in the appropriate cell.
8. Sum B4:B9 in B10
9. In C1 calculate the percentage of of blue =B1/B17*100 and do the same for the other colors
10. Create a bar chart (insert chart) to display the percentage (y axis) of each color (x axis) and a pie chart
11. Compare and contrast data
12. Use the actual candy to create a real model of the graphs
13. Alternatively if candy is not available students can this data 10% blue 30% brown 10% green 20% red 10% orange 20% yellow
