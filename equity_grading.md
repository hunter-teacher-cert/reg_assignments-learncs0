I do agree that we should rethink grading.  Specifically, we should try different approaches throughout the year like self assessments or rubrics or digital portfolios or credit for practice or live feedback or traditional 0-100 or 0-4 or letter grades.  Students should have exposure to various grading methods and should have multiple opportunities to improve their scores if they choose.  I do try different grading methods.  For example, kids can do retakes or they can demonstrate their understanding by doing an oral exam etc.  The goal is to accurately describe a studentâ€™s level of content understanding holistically while giving them varied and multiple opportunities to master the material.
