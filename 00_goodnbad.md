**Describe an instance when you were teaching somthing computer science related and it went poorly.**
Students struggled to understand the coordinate plane in p5js; students also struggled locating symbols like the curly brace/brakckets, parentheses, etc. on the keyboard.

**Why do you think it didn't go well?**
Students needed more practice with coordinates on paper and on the editor as well as keyboarding practice to locate keys.

**What would you do (have you done) to make it better?**
The next day we did drills on creating shapes with different coordinates - on paper and on the p5js editor; students also practiced naming and typing common keyboard symbols

**Describe an instance when you were teaching somthing computer science related and it went really well.**
students were given code to reorganize/put in order to create a face and they enjoyed the task and wanted to customize their own.

**Why do you think it went so well?**
It went well because it was a trial and error activity; students could see where the shapes appeared as they rearranged their code.
