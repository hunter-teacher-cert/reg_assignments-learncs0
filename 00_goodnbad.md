Describe an instance when you were teaching somthing computer science related and it went poorly.
Students struggled to understand the coordinate plane in p5js.  

Why do you think it didn't go well?
They needed more practice with corrdinates on the paper and on the platform. 

What would you do (have you done) to make it better?
The next day we did drills on creating shapes with different coordinates - on paper and on the p5 platform.

Describe an instance when you were teaching somthing computer science related and it went really well.
students were give code to reorganize to create a face.

Why do you think it went so well?
It went well because it was a trial and error activity; students could see where the shapes appeared as they rearranged their code.
